## What is Kristify

Kristify is a new, modular and modern krist shop software made for ComputerCraft:Tweaked (A minecraft mod).
It was made for a bounty posted by some of the moderators in the [MCCM discord](https://discord.gg/minecraft-computer-mods-477910221872824320).

We focus on modularity and customization, while also providing a secure and bulletproof solution.

### What is ComputerCraft:Tweaked / CC:T

Once upon a time a man named Daniel "Dan200" Ratcliffe decided to create the greatest minecraft mod of all time. Computercraft.
A few years later, he went dark on the ComputerCraft side. He left.
The fork "ComputerCraft:Tweaked" was created. It has been greatly adopted by most ComputerCraft players. CC:T is a aberration for ComputerCraft:Tweaked.
